## ISMRM 2021

This material will be presented at the ISMRM Annual Meeting 2021.

**Title**: Software Demos for MRI
**Meeting**: [2021 ISMRM Annual Meeting, Online](https://www.ismrm.org/21m/)
**Date**: May 16, 2021


## Schedule
This folder contains standalone demos that show different BART use cases. The demos are self-documented within
each directory, and are summarized below. Each tutorial is set up as jupyter notebook and can interactively be tested using Google Colaboratory.
